                    <p>Wylene Branton Wood is a lifelong educator, who as a teacher and volunteer has involved herself in activities to promote education, social justice and equality.  Born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, Wylene grew up in a family and a community involved in calling for justice and battling segregation.

These programs presented little known information about the social and economic contributions of peoples of the African Diaspora to the development of towns along the Lower Hudson River and were designed to enlighten all Rocklanders but especially school children in grades 6-11.
